Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this lab, you will be able to:
• Cable a network according to the topology diagram
• Erase the startup configuration and reload a switch to the default state
• Perform basic configuration tasks on a switch
• Create VLANs
• Assign switch ports to a VLAN
• Add, move, and change ports
• Verify VLAN configuration
• Enable trunking on inter-switch connections
• Verify trunk configuration
• Save the VLAN configuration


Task 1: Prepare the Network
Step 1: Cable a network.

Step 2: Clear any existing configurations on the switches, and initialize all ports in the shutdown
state.
If necessary, refer to Lab 2.5.1, Appendix 1, for the procedure to clear switch configurations.
It is a good practice to disable any unused ports on the switches by putting them in shutdown. Disable all
ports on the switches:

Switch#config term
Switch(config)#interface range fa0/1-24
Switch(config-if-range)#shutdown
Switch(config-if-range)#interface range gi0/1-2
Switch(config-if-range)#shutdown

Task 2: Perform Basic Switch Configurations
Step 1: Configure the switches according to the following guidelines.
• Configure the switch hostname.
• Disable DNS lookup.
• Configure an EXEC mode password of class.
• Configure a password of cisco for console connections.
• Configure a password of cisco for vty connections.
Step 2: Re-enable the user ports on S2 and S3.

S2(config)#interface range [int1,int2,....]
S2(config-if-range)# switchport mode access
S2(config-if-range)#no shutdown


Task 3: Configure and Activate Ethernet Interfaces
Step 1: Configure the PCs.

You can complete this lab using only two PCs by simply changing the IP addressing for the two PCs
specific to a test you want to conduct. For example, if you want to test connectivity between PC1 and
PC2, then configure the IP addresses for those PCs by referring to the addressing table at the beginning
of the lab. Alternatively, you can configure all six PCs with the IP addresses and default gateways.

Task 4: Configure VLANs on the Switch
Step 1: Create VLANs on switch S1.
Use the vlan vlan-id command in global configuration mode to add a VLAN to switch S1.. After you create the VLAN, you will be in vlan configuration mode, where you can
assign a name to the VLAN with the name vlan name command.

S1(config)#vlan [vlan id]
S1(config-vlan)#name [vlan name]
S1(config-vlan)#end

S1#
Step 2: Verify that the VLANs have been created on S1.
Use the show vlan brief command to verify that the VLANs have been created.
S1# show vlan brief


What ports are currently assigned to the four VLANs you have created?
_______________________________

Step 4: Assign switch ports to VLANs.

Ports are assigned to VLANs in interface configuration
mode, using the switchport access vlan vlan-id command. You can assign each port individually or you
can use the interface range command to simplify this task, as shown here. The commands are shown for
S3 only, Save your configuration when done.

S3(config)#interface range [int range]
S3(config-if-range)#switchport access vlan [vlan id]
S3(config-if-range)#end
S3#copy running-config startup-config
Destination filename [startup-config]? [enter]
Building configuration...
[OK]

Step 4: Determine which ports have been added.
Use the show vlan id vlan-number command on S2 to see which ports are assigned to VLAN [id].
Which ports are assigned to VLAN [vlan id]?
_______________________________________________________

Note: The show vlan id vlan-name displays the same output.
You can also view VLAN assignment information using the show interfaces interface switchport
command.



Step 5: Configure trunking and the native VLAN for the trunking ports on all switches.
Trunks are connections between the switches that allow the switches to exchange information for all
VLANS. By default, a trunk port belongs to all VLANs, as opposed to an access port, which can only
belong to a single VLAN. If the switch supports both ISL and 802.1Q VLAN encapsulation, the trunks
must specify which method is being used. Because the 2960 switch only supports 802.1Q trunking, it is
not specified in this lab.

A native VLAN is assigned to an 802.1Q trunk port. In the topology, the native VLAN is VLAN 99. An
802.1Q trunk port supports traffic coming from many VLANs (tagged traffic) as well as traffic that does not
come from a VLAN (untagged traffic). The 802.1Q trunk port places untagged traffic on the native VLAN.
Untagged traffic is generated by a computer attached to a switch port that is configured with the native
VLAN. One of the IEEE 802.1Q specifications for Native VLANs is to maintain backward compatibility with
untagged traffic common to legacy LAN scenarios. For the purposes of this lab, a native VLAN serves as
a common identifier on opposing ends of a trunk link. It is a best practice to use a VLAN other than VLAN
1 as the native VLAN.


Use the interface range command in global configuration mode to simplify configuring trunking.
S1(config)#interface range [int1,int2,....]
S1(config-if-range)#switchport mode trunk
S1(config-if-range)#no shutdown
S1(config-if-range)#end

Verify that the trunks have been configured with the show interface trunk command.
S1#show interface trunk
